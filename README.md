# LSTM Time Series Applications

This repository demonstrates five practical applications of the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for time series analysis:

1. Stock Price Prediction (`stock_price_prediction.py`)
2. Weather Forecasting (`weather_forecasting.py`)
3. Energy Consumption Forecasting (`energy_consumption.py`)
4. Language Modeling (`language_modeling.py`)
5. Anomaly Detection in Time Series (`anomaly_detection.py`)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow (Keras)
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each script is standalone and can be run independently. Example:

```bash
python stock_price_prediction.py
```

Replace the sample data loading sections with your own data as needed.
